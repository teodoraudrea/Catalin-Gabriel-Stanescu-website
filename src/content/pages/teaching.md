# Teaching Experience

My teaching activity spans more than two decades and reflects a sustained engagement with legal education across jurisdictions, academic cultures, and levels of study. I have taught core and advanced courses in private law, international economic law, consumer law, law and technology, and law and political economy, combining doctrinal rigor with critical and interdisciplinary perspectives. My pedagogical approach is shaped by comparative reasoning, socio-legal analysis, and a strong emphasis on conceptual clarity.

## Academic Scope and Levels

I have taught at undergraduate (LL.B.), graduate (LL.M.), doctoral (PhD), and pre-university levels. This vertical integration of teaching has allowed me to adapt both content and method to different stages of legal formation, from foundational legal reasoning to advanced theoretical and methodological debates. My courses often serve both disciplinary and interdisciplinary audiences, including students with backgrounds in law, economics, political science, and international relations.

## Subject Areas

My primary teaching fields include:

- Private Law and Obligations  
- Consumer Law and Consumer Financial Protection  
- Law and Economics  
- International Business and Economic Law  
- Digitalisation, Platforms, and Algorithmic Governance  
- Comparative and Transnational Private Law  

Across these areas, I consistently integrate questions of power, market structure, institutional design, and vulnerability, encouraging students to move beyond formalism and engage critically with law as a social and economic ordering system.

## Teaching Philosophy and Method

My teaching philosophy rests on three pillars: conceptual precision, contextualisation, and critical engagement. I aim to equip students not only with legal knowledge, but with analytical tools that allow them to interrogate legal institutions and practices across jurisdictions and historical contexts.

Methodologically, my courses combine lectures with problem-based learning, case analysis, policy evaluation, and structured discussions. I frequently use comparative case studies, regulatory failures, and real-world disputes to illustrate abstract legal concepts. In advanced courses, students are encouraged to develop their own research questions and to reflect on the limits of legal regulation.

## Curriculum Development and Course Design

I have designed and coordinated multiple courses from scratch, including advanced seminars and full-semester lecture courses. This includes defining learning objectives, developing syllabi, selecting interdisciplinary reading materials, designing assignments, and constructing examinations aligned with both academic standards and institutional requirements.

Several of my courses reflect emerging research agendas, particularly in the areas of digital finance, algorithmic governance, and informal regulatory practices. This research-led teaching ensures that students engage with cutting-edge debates and unresolved legal questions rather than settled doctrine alone.

## Supervision and Mentorship

I have supervised bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral students on topics ranging from private law doctrine to interdisciplinary socio-legal research. My supervisory approach emphasises intellectual independence, methodological transparency, and sustained engagement with primary sources. I place particular importance on helping students translate broad interests into coherent research designs.

## Institutional and Geographic Experience

My teaching experience includes appointments and guest teaching at universities across Europe, including institutions in Denmark, Central and Eastern Europe, and beyond. Teaching in diverse academic environments has sharpened my sensitivity to different pedagogical traditions, assessment cultures, and student expectations, while reinforcing my commitment to high academic standards and inclusive classroom dynamics.

## Assessment and Examination

I have extensive experience in designing and grading written and oral examinations, take-home exams, research papers, and continuous assessment formats. My assessment practice is guided by transparency, consistency, and constructive feedback, with the aim of supporting students’ intellectual development rather than merely ranking performance.

## Pedagogical Outlook

At its core, my teaching seeks to demystify law without trivialising it. I view legal education as a formative process that should cultivate critical judgment, ethical awareness, and intellectual courage. In an era of platform governance, automated decision-making, and financialisation, I consider it essential that legal education prepares students to confront uncertainty, complexity, and institutional fragility with both analytical discipline and normative awareness.
