# My Reading List for the Year

I read very little this year. The first half was so busy with reading and writing for work that I could hardly find the energy to open a book *for myself*. I've managed some in the second half. It's nothing impressive, just so there is something. I had commuted quite a bit this year, so audiobooks were *handier* as they did not solicit me as much as reading. To simplify it, I chose *easy books* and re-reads, mostly in my native tongue. The list is, as always, below, with brief impressions.

## History

### Books

1. **Julius Norwich - Kingdom in the Sun (2)**  
   This sweeping historical account of Norman Sicily is a masterpiece of storytelling and scholarly insight. Norwich vividly depicts a kingdom that thrived as a beacon of (apparent) tolerance, innovation, and cultural fusion amidst a turbulent medieval Europe. Unfortunately, the kingdom proved as ephemeral as impressive it was to build. A pleasurable read – one of the highlights of this year.

2. **Rodney Stark — God’s Battalions**  
   A brief history of the Crusades that refutes the conventional narratives of *Christian aggression* and *colonialism*. It presents a more balanced and fact-based view of these tumultuous events. It’s an intriguing read for those interested in medieval history and the clash of civilizations. *Must read.*

3. **Thomas Weber - Hitler’s First War**  
   Weber’s deep dive into Hitler’s experience during World War I reveals a complex and often contradictory figure. The book provides crucial insights into the making of one of history’s most infamous leaders. *Too scholarly at times.*

4. **Walter Eytan - The First Ten Years: Israel Between East & West**  
   This book explores the first decade of Israel’s existence, highlighting its geopolitical challenges and the cultural tensions between East and West. Eytan’s work provides an insightful look at a young nation finding its place on the global stage. It helps one understand what Israel has been dealing with since regaining its independence in 1947.

### Audiobooks

1. **James Barr - Lords of the Desert**  
   An absorbing history of the Western powers’ struggle for dominance in the Middle East. Barr highlights the long-lasting consequences of imperial ambitions. Alongside a current apologist approach to history and world events, the book has a strong pro-Arab stance (in line with British approaches) and conveniently leaves out some key aspects—such as the Arab–Israeli wars after 1947—to advance its anti-Western narrative. *Interesting, informative, biased.*

2. **Hampton Sides - The Wide Wide Sea**  
   A compelling exploration of human ambition and the natural world. Sides’ audiobook captures the awe-inspiring power of the oceans. I knew almost nothing about James Cook and found it very informative. *Worth reading.*

3. **Martin Rady - The Middle Kingdoms**  
   A fascinating look at Central Europe’s history, unveiling the complex interplay of cultures and powers that shaped this region. Minor errors appear, perhaps due to an over-reliance on Western sources. Otherwise, pretty good. *Worth reading.*

## Non-Fiction

### Books

1. **Cornel Ban - Dependenta si dezvoltare. Economia politica a capitalismului romanesc**  
   Ban’s in-depth analysis of Romanian political economy delves into the dependency theories that shaped the country’s capitalist trajectory. This critical work examines how global structures influence national development and economic policies. A rational and factual account of Romania's neoliberal path after the Revolution. *Must read if you want to understand the last 35 years in Romania.*

2. **Fritz Bartel - The Triumph of Broken Promises**  
   A powerful examination of the political and social upheavals in the communist bloc. This book illustrates how shattered promises shaped modern political and economic governance in Eastern Europe. *A must.*

3. **Vladimir Pasti - Noul Capitalism Romanesc**  
   A critical analysis of Romania’s economic transformation post-communism, dissecting the promises and pitfalls of capitalism. An incisive look at how capitalism developed after the fall of communism in Romania. *Also a must, for those seeking a fact-based understanding of the past 35 years.*

### Audiobooks

1. **Robert Greene - 48 Rules of Power**  
   A modern guide to strategy and influence, distilling historical examples into actionable lessons for navigating power dynamics. Someone once remarked that I lack *emotional intelligence* (a polite way of saying I struggle in social situations and office politics), and this book showed countless ways I could have reacted better if I'd played the power game right. *For those interested in such games, read this book.*

2. **Bob Norwood - War**  
   An evocative narrative capturing the Biden administration's approach to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Despite his well-known dislike of Trump, Norwood’s comments on Trump were surprisingly positive. It offered a fresh perspective on the times we’re living in.

3. **Yaroslav Trofimov - Our Enemies Will Vanish**  
   A gripping account of the first year of the war in Ukraine, providing crucial context to the events that led to it and their consequences. *Worth reading.*

4. **Douglas Murray - The War on the West**  
   A provocative critique of contemporary Western society that challenges readers to rethink modern cultural debates. Although I agree with most of his points, I found some of the *evidence* too weak. It could have been better.

## Fiction

### Books

1. **Mihai Radu - Respira**  
   A short yet gripping novel about kidnapping, frustration, desperation, and hopelessness. It kept me hooked from start to finish.

2. **Linwood Barclay - Elevator Pitch**  
   A thriller that hooks readers from the first page with a chilling premise: a serial killer targeting elevators in a bustling city. This fast-paced narrative keeps you on edge while subtly exploring themes of urban vulnerability and fear. It's the kind of junk literature that's only worth reading on a beach bed.

3. **Haruki Murakami - The City and Its Uncertain Walls**  
   I've waited the entire year for this one. Murakami’s latest offering blends the surreal with the introspective, taking readers on a journey through a labyrinth of memory and dreams. It’s a meditation on the fragility of identity and the elusive nature of human connections. I expected something else, I think.

4. **Jo Nesbo - The Killing Moon**  
   Another entry from the Harry Hole series, this Nordic noir tale of murder and intrigue is still compelling, even as it runs out of acquaintances to kill. *To be enjoyed while lounging in the sun.*

### Audiobooks

1. **Eric Emmanuel Schmidt - Cele mai frumoase povestiri**  
   A collection of short stories that evoke nostalgia and wonder, weaving life lessons into their narrative fabric. I enjoyed it and even laughed at times.

2. **Heather Morris - The Tattooist of Auschwitz**  
   A heart-wrenching account of love and survival in one of history’s darkest periods, this audiobook brings humanity to a place of unimaginable suffering. *Worth reading.*

3. **Frederik Backman - Anxious People**  
   A heartwarming and hilarious exploration of human vulnerability, this tale of a botched bank robbery turned hostage situation is a testament to the beauty of flawed lives. A book that speaks directly to you. *Definitely this year's fiction highlight. An absolute must!*

4. **Frederik Backman - My Grandmother Sends Her Regards and Apologies**  
   An enchanting tale following a young girl, Elsa, as she unravels a treasure hunt left by her eccentric grandmother. Through letters and adventures, Elsa learns about death, forgiveness, love, and the healing power of stories. It’s a heartwarming reminder of bonds that transcend generations. *Too long to get to the point at times, but it started and ended well.*

5. **Frederik Backman - The Deal of a Lifetime**  
   A reflective and poignant novella that examines the price of success and the sacrifices we make for those we love. Backman’s narrative reminds us of the value of a life well-lived and the impact of our choices. *Makes one think...*

6. **Frederik Backman - And Every Morning The Way Home Gets Longer and Longer**  
   A touching meditation on memory and loss, this novella explores a grandfather’s journey through dementia and his relationship with his grandson. Backman’s tender prose captures the bittersweet beauty of holding on and letting go. *Harrowing and well-written.*

7. **Frederik Backman - A Man Called Ove**  
   The story of a grumpy yet lovable widower whose life takes an unexpected turn when he’s drawn into the lives of his quirky neighbours. This humorous and heartfelt novel celebrates the transformative power of community and kindness. *Another good one.*

## Science Fiction & Fantasy

1. **George R.R. Martin – A Song of Ice and Fire Series (Books 1-4)**  
   These epic tales of power, betrayal, and the struggle for the Iron Throne remain captivating in audio form. Having read them a decade ago, I feared I might no longer enjoy them—but I did.

2. **George R.R. Martin – Fire and Blood**  
   This rich history of House Targaryen chronicles the rise and reign of the dragonlords in Westeros. With vivid tales of conquest, betrayal, and ambition, Martin’s account reads like a compelling blend of myth and historical epic. *It’s like reading a real history of actual events.*

3. **Stephen King – JFK 11.22.63**  
   King’s time-traveling protagonist attempts to prevent one of America’s most infamous assassinations. The audiobook masterfully blends history with speculative fiction, exploring the consequences of altering the past. *Very nice, very compelling – worth your time.*

4. **Jeff VanderMeer – Annihilation**  
   A surreal and unsettling journey into an environmental anomaly known as Area X, this audiobook explores themes of identity, transformation, and the limits of human understanding. VanderMeer’s prose is hauntingly vivid, though the ending leaves you wondering what it was all about. I purchased the second volume of the trilogy, hoping for more clarity next year.

5. **Andrzej Sapkowski – The Last Wish**  
   The book introduces Geralt of Rivia, a witcher who battles monsters while grappling with moral dilemmas. It became apparent that many events are only loosely connected—what seemed like a continuous narrative turned out to be a collection of short stories. The lack of a coherent narrative discouraged me from proceeding with the rest of the series. *Not for me.*

There were more I started but did not complete. As usual, they will be on next year's list if I finish them. Few as they were, this year’s readings have enriched my understanding of history, current events, human nature, and the power of storytelling.

**How about you? How does your list look like?**
